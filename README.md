**Cryptocurrency Clustering**

This project involves performing clustering analysis on a cryptocurrency dataset. The goal is to use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering to find patterns and groupings in the data.

Getting Started

Instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, hvplot

Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<Your_Github_Username>/cryptocurrency_clustering.git

Install necessary libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open Crypto_Clustering.ipynb in a Colab.research.google. notebook
Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.

Project Steps

Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.
Normalize the data using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
Use PCA to reduce the features to three principal components.
Determine the best number of clusters (k) using the Elbow Method.
Use K-Means to cluster the cryptocurrencies.
Visualize the clusters using hvPlot.
